First line: <Name> <Number of variables (N)> <Maximum domain size>
<Number of constraints> <Global upper bound of weights (greater than the
maximum weight of all constraints)>

Second line: <Domain size of variable 0> ... <Domain size of variable N-1>

Starting from the 3rd line, constraints are listed one after another.

For each constraint,

First line: <Arity of constraint> <index of 1st variable in the
constraint> ... <index of last variable in the constraint> <Default
weight> <Number of tuples with weights different from the default weight>

Starting from the second line of each constraint, each weight is listed
per line.

<value assigned to the first variable> <value assigned to the second
variable> ... <value assigned to the last variable> <weight of this tuple>

# are my comments. They won't appear in the real files.)
