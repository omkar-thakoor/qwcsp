abstract = {The QCSP+ language we introduce extends the framework of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSPs) by enabling us to neatly express restricted quantifications via a chain of nested CSPs to be interpreted as alternately conjuncted and disjuncted. Restricted quantifiers turn out to be a convenient solution to the crippling modeling issues we encounter in QCSP and--surprisingly-- they help to reuse propagation technology and to prune the search space. Our QCSP+ solver--which also handles arithmetic and global constraints-- exhibits state-of-the-art performances.},
